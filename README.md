# digital-equity-atlas

Digital Equity Atlas maps and quantifies the digital divide at the municipal level by using trustworthy public datasets from government databases, international organizations, and other reliable sources. Data is loaded in Python with Pandas and NumPy, then explored to understand schema and content. The pipeline identifies and handles missing values, outliers, and data errors, and applies cleaning to ensure quality before analysis. It then performs descriptive analysis to reveal patterns, trends, and distributions, computing measures of central tendency, variance, percentiles, and other relevant statistics, and visualizing results with Matplotlib. Finally, it interprets the findings to highlight key conclusions about the selected problem, and discusses implications for decision making, policy, investment, and community action.
